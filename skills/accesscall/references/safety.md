# AccessCall

[#accesscall](#accesscall)

Use this skill when a user wants to conduct an accessibility intake interview by phone instead of a web form, typically to support a Section 508 or WCAG conformance audit (VPAT 2.4).

Accessibility intake forms are themselves often inaccessible: screen reader fatigue, motor impairment, low vision, or cognitive load can all block someone from completing the exact form meant to capture their barrier report. AccessCall places a short phone call instead, conducts a structured verbal interview, and returns a result that maps onto standard VPAT 2.4 conformance report fields.

## When To Use

[#when-to-use](#when-to-use)

Use this skill for:

- accessibility intake for someone who cannot use a web-based audit form
- gathering verbal barrier reports to populate a VPAT 2.4 / Section 508 audit report
- "call and ask about accessibility issues" or similar one-off outbound intake requests

## When Not To Use

[#when-not-to-use](#when-not-to-use)

Do not use this skill to:

- place a call without the user explicitly confirming the recipient and their intent first
- guess a phone number's country code or region; ask if ambiguous
- call a third party who is not the requesting user without documented prior consent from that person
- auto-populate a VPAT row when the follow-up contact was never confirmed back to the caller (see Safety Rules)
- treat the auto-selected WCAG criterion row as final without human review; matching is done at the WCAG principle level (Perceivable / Operable / Understandable / Robust), not the specific success criterion

## Setup

[#setup](#setup)

`scripts/format-to-vpat.js` depends on `docx`, `jszip`, and `xml-js` (declared in `package.json`). Run `npm install` inside `skills/accesscall/` before using it — without this step it fails immediately with `Cannot find module 'jszip'`. `scripts/parse-recap.js` and `scripts/phone-utils.js` have no external dependencies and need no install step.

## Core Workflow

[#core-workflow](#core-workflow)

1. Confirm required inputs: recipient phone number, product or site name being audited, preferred language (default English, US). Ask for anything missing; do not fabricate a phone number or product name.
2. Validate the phone number against E.164 (`scripts/phone-utils.js`, `isE164`/`assertE164`) before calling `plan_call`. If it does not match E.164 format, reject it and ask the user to correct it — do not reformat, guess a country code, or silently pass a malformed number through to `plan_call`.
3. Call `plan_call` with the goal built from `references/call-task-template.md`, filling in `recipient_name` and `product_or_site_name`. Do not forward the user's full latest message verbatim via `user_input` by default — that field exists on `plan_call` for resolving an ambiguous/malformed phone number, not as a general passthrough. Only populate `user_input` when there's an actual number to disambiguate, and even then pass just the relevant phone-number text, not the user's entire message. The `goal` string alone carries `recipient_name`/`product_or_site_name`/language into the call.
4. Show the `confirm_summary` to the user and wait for explicit confirmation. Do not call `run_call` until the user confirms.
5. Immediately before calling `run_call`, acquire the dispatch lock (`scripts/call-lock.js`, `acquireLock`) keyed on the recipient's phone number, the purpose `"accesscall-intake"`, and this specific `plan_id` — every lock is owned by the `plan_id` that acquired it. If a call to this recipient is already locked by a *different* `plan_id` — including on a retry after a crash or timeout, which will see the same lock a first attempt wrote — refuse to place another and ask the user to explicitly confirm an override before retrying. `acquireLock` also refuses unconditionally (even with override) if this exact `plan_id` was already dispatched before, per its durable dispatch history — a `plan_id` must never be replayed. The lock does not expire on a timer; it is only released in step 7, once a confirmed terminal status exists.
   - **Before ever passing `override`:** run `scripts/call-lock.js`'s `checkLock` first and show the human the *current* owning `plan_id` and `generation` — never override from memory or a stale earlier check. Overriding requires passing that exact `generation` as `expectedGeneration`; `acquireLock` re-verifies inside the same atomic critical section that the on-disk generation still matches before writing, and refuses with a clear "state has changed" error if it doesn't (e.g. a different override already went through in the meantime). This exists because the per-recipient mutex alone only serializes writes against each other — it does not stop two *separately, legitimately approved* overrides (each based on what looked like current state at approval time) from both eventually succeeding one after the other against state that changed in between. Never retry an override with the same `expectedGeneration` after a mismatch; re-check and decide again.
6. Call `run_call` with the `confirm_token` exactly as received. Never call it more than once for the same `plan_id`.
7. Poll `get_call_run` every 1-3 seconds while the run is active, then slow down, until a terminal status. As soon as one of `COMPLETED`/`FAILED`/`NO_ANSWER`/`DECLINED`/`CANCELED`/`CANCELLED`/`VOICEMAIL`/`BUSY`/`EXPIRED` is confirmed, call `scripts/call-lock.js`'s `releaseLock` with that same `plan_id` and status to release the dispatch lock from step 5. `releaseLock` is compare-and-delete: it only releases if the `plan_id` given still matches the lock's current owner, so a delayed/late result for a `plan_id` that has since been overridden by a different dispatch is refused rather than freeing someone else's lock. Never release speculatively or because polling has taken a while — an unresolved status keeps the lock held until it either resolves or the user explicitly overrides.
8. This MCP server's `plan_call` has no schema-input parameter for structured extraction (verified against its `inputSchema`). Instead, the call goal (`references/call-task-template.md`) instructs the bot to recap its own answers in a fixed, labeled format at the end of the call. Parse that recap from the transcript using `scripts/parse-recap.js`, which only reads lines attributable to the bot's own final speaking turn (never anything the caller said) and validates the result against `references/intake-result.schema.json` before returning it.
9. If parsing/validation fails — including when the recap never happened because the crisis-safety override in `references/call-task-template.md` triggered, or because the recap couldn't be cleanly attributed to the bot — do not guess field values. Report the crisis disclosure (if that's what happened) as its own distinct, clearly flagged outcome. Otherwise, surface a redacted excerpt of the transcript via `scripts/redact-transcript.js` — never the raw, unredacted transcript, which may contain the caller's spoken phone number or email address.
10. If `followup_contact` is present, it must only be trusted when `followup_contact_confirmed` is `true`, meaning the bot spelled the contact back letter-by-letter and the caller explicitly confirmed it. If not confirmed, do not carry it into VPAT output; note "Contact unconfirmed, verify manually" instead.
11. Optionally run `scripts/format-to-vpat.js` to insert the validated result into a VPAT 2.4 template as a new row. Every auto-matched row (matched at the WCAG principle level, not the specific success criterion) gets an "AUTO-MATCHED AT PRINCIPLE LEVEL, HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE AUDIT USE" note in Remarks, so it can never be mistaken for a final placement.

**Why a `plan_id` is never replayed, even with `override` (step 5):** this is a permanent design choice, not a gap to eventually fix. `run_call`'s own tool contract already forbids calling it twice for the same `plan_id` — this skill didn't invent that restriction, it's upstream. Every genuine reason to "retry" collapses into needing a brand-new `plan_id` anyway: if the recipient asks for a callback with a corrected detail, that's a different goal, which only `plan_call` can produce (there is no operation that patches an existing plan's parameters); if the process crashes between acquiring the lock and getting a response from `run_call`, you don't actually know whether the call was placed, and retrying the same `plan_id` risks a real duplicate dispatch at the API level, so the correct recovery is a fresh `plan_id` from a new `plan_call`, with the interrupted attempt's outcome flagged to the user as unknown rather than silently retried. `override` therefore only ever needs to resolve one kind of conflict — a *different*, newly-planned `plan_id` wanting to dispatch while the lock is still held by an unresolved *other* `plan_id` — never "let me reuse this one."

## Safety Rules

[#safety-rules](#safety-rules)

- Never place a call without the user explicitly confirming the recipient and intent first. Setup/verification steps must never trigger `run_call`.
- Never guess a phone number's country code or region.
- Reject any phone number that fails E.164 validation (`scripts/phone-utils.js`) before it ever reaches `plan_call`; ask the user to correct it instead of silently passing it through.
- Mask phone numbers in any logged output or printed summary (e.g. `+1555010****`, via `scripts/phone-utils.js`'s `maskPhone`) — the only place the full, unmasked number belongs is the actual `plan_call`/`run_call` API invocation itself.
- Never forward the user's full latest chat message to `plan_call`'s `user_input` by default. Only pass the minimum text needed, and only when actually needed to resolve an ambiguous or malformed phone number.
- Acquire the dispatch lock (`scripts/call-lock.js`) with this `plan_id` immediately before every `run_call`, and only ever release it (`releaseLock`) with that same `plan_id` once `get_call_run` confirms a terminal status — never on a timer, never speculatively, and never for a lock currently owned by a different `plan_id`. Never place a duplicate call to the same recipient while a lock is held by another `plan_id` without an explicit user override, and never replay a `plan_id` that the dispatch history shows was already dispatched, even with an override.
- Never pass `override` without first calling `checkLock` and showing the human the current owner and `generation`, and never pass a `generation` other than what that check just returned. `acquireLock` re-verifies the generation still matches on-disk immediately before writing and refuses if it doesn't — this is what stops two separately-approved overrides from both succeeding against state that changed between approval and execution.
- Never surface a raw, unredacted transcript to the user as a validation-failure fallback. Redact it first (`scripts/redact-transcript.js`, which masks phone-length digit sequences of any format — not just US shapes — and email addresses) — it does not detect spoken street addresses, so treat its output as a partial, not complete, redaction.
- Never call a third party without documented prior consent from that person.
- A confirmed contact detail (email or phone for follow-up) requires an explicit letter-by-letter spell-back and a "yes" from the caller. Testing showed the STT layer can introduce transcription errors (e.g. inserting a duplicate word into a domain); the spell-back is a mitigation, not a guarantee, since a caller can still mishear their own readback and confirm an incorrect value. Document this limitation to the end user rather than presenting the mechanism as fully reliable.
- Auto-matched VPAT rows are matched at the WCAG principle level only. Flag rows for manual review rather than guessing the exact success criterion — `scripts/format-to-vpat.js` always writes an explicit "AUTO-MATCHED AT PRINCIPLE LEVEL, HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE AUDIT USE" note into Remarks for these rows.
- If the caller discloses anything suggesting self-harm, suicidal ideation, or a crisis during the call, the accessibility interview must stop — this is a required override in `references/call-task-template.md`, not optional bot judgment. Do not attempt to extract intake fields from that call. Report it to the user as a distinct, clearly flagged outcome, not as a normal or partial intake result.
- Do not expose auth tokens, confirmation tokens, or credentials in any output.

## Known Limitations

[#known-limitations](#known-limitations)

- This skill supports one-off calls only. There is no recurring or scheduled-call capability.
- There is no mid-call cancellation path. Once `run_call` starts, the call runs to a terminal status (`COMPLETED`, `NO_ANSWER`, `DECLINED`, `FAILED`, etc.) — it cannot be stopped or cancelled from within this skill while in progress.

## Output Format

[#output-format](#output-format)

After a completed call, report:

- call status and duration
- the recipient's phone number, masked (e.g. `+1555010****`) — never print the full number in a summary
- the parsed structured result (assistive technology, task attempted, barrier category, severity, consent to follow-up)
- whether follow-up contact was confirmed
- if a VPAT insertion was run, which template row was modified, its new values, and that it is an auto-match requiring human review before audit use

If the call did not complete (no answer, declined, failed), report the status plainly and do not fabricate a result.

If the caller disclosed a self-harm/suicidal-ideation/crisis situation, report that as its own distinct, clearly flagged outcome instead of an intake result — do not attempt to backfill or guess the intake fields that weren't asked.
