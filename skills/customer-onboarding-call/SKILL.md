# Customer Onboarding Call

Use this skill when a new signup should receive a short welcome call and the business wants the
conversation to end as structured data rather than as an unread recording.

`customer-onboarding-call` turns one signup event into at most one **conversation**, one structured
result, and at most one follow-up task. Obtaining that conversation may take up to three attempts on
an unreliable corridor, with only one attempt in flight at a time; see *Attempts, Retries, and
Cancellation*. It does not create recurring schedules, call campaigns, or contact lists. Recurrence,
if the business wants it, belongs to the host scheduler; see [`call-reminder`](../call-reminder/).

The workflow is deliberately narrow: welcome, consent, discovery, next-step offer, wrap-up. A call
that tries to sell, negotiate, collect payment, or resolve a support ticket is out of scope.

## When To Use

Use this skill for:

- welcoming a customer who just signed up and confirming they can get started
- collecting first-party onboarding context: business type, goal, prior tooling, blockers
- detecting whether a customer wants a human to follow up
- turning a spoken answer into a CRM field and an assigned task
- measuring activation coverage when a team cannot call every signup manually

## When Not To Use

Do not use this skill to:

- call people who did not sign up or otherwise ask to be contacted
- run sales, collections, renewal, or win-back calls
- deliver medical, legal, financial, or emergency instructions
- read pricing, delivery windows, contractual terms, or policy from memory
- retry indefinitely after a customer declines or asks not to be called
- re-call a customer who has already completed an onboarding call, unless the user explicitly asks

## Required Fields

For each call, require:

- `customerName`
- `phoneNumber` in E.164
- `companyName` for the agent to introduce itself as
- `companyDescription`, one sentence the agent may state as fact

Optional:

- `businessName`
- `locale` and `region` hints for the conversation

Ask for any missing required field. Do not infer a phone number, country code, or region from a
locale, an IP address, an email domain, or unrelated prior context.

## Core Workflow

1. Confirm the signup is real and recent, and that this customer has not already been called.
2. Build the call task from the required fields. Keep the script to roughly two minutes.
3. Attach a structured result schema so the provider returns fields, not just a transcript. See
   [`references/structured-result.md`](references/structured-result.md).
4. Persist an attempt record under a uniqueness constraint on `(signup_id, attempt_no)` **before**
   dialing, and derive the provider idempotency key from it. Refuse to start a new attempt while
   another is in flight for the same signup.
5. Place the call for that attempt.
6. Receive the terminal result on a webhook. Treat delivery as at-least-once and key ingestion on
   the provider event id.
7. Classify the outcome before writing anything: Stage A decides whether a human took part, and only
   then does Stage B read consent. See *Outcome Classification* below.
8. Write only what the outcome permits, then queue a follow-up task only when the outcome is
   `onboarded` and the customer asked for one.
9. Schedule or cancel a retry according to *Attempts, Retries, and Cancellation*.

Use this shape:

```text
signup -> attempt record -> call task + result schema -> attempt -> terminal webhook
       -> classify -> permitted CRM write -> follow-up or retry or suppress
```

## Conversation Shape

Keep the call in this order. Allow interruption at any point.

1. **Greet and identify.** Name the customer, name the company, state that the call may be
   recorded if that is true in your jurisdiction.
2. **Ask consent.** Ask whether now is a good time for a short call. If the answer is no, offer to
   call back later and end. Do not continue discovery after a soft refusal.
3. **Discovery.** Ask what kind of business they run, why they signed up, what problem they want
   solved, and whether they have used something similar before. One question at a time.
4. **Offer the next step.** Invite the concrete first action, and offer a human if they prefer.
5. **Wrap up.** Summarize what will happen next, thank them, end.

The agent may answer only from `companyDescription` and any knowledge base you explicitly supply.
For anything else — price, delivery time, policy, availability — it must say it will have a human
follow up. Inventing these is the most common failure mode of onboarding-call agents.

## State Machine

The full contract in one view. Every arrow that ends in a call is guarded; every terminal state
says what it permits.

```

Invariants the diagram encodes:

- **A redial requires positive no-human evidence from a closed set.** A missing result, an
  extractor-claimed `NotReached`, an unreachable provider, an expired lease, and a billing charge
  are all *unknown* — they route to `needs-review`, never to a retry.
- **Releasing a stuck attempt and authorising a redial are separate decisions.** Unblocking the
  slot is bookkeeping; dialling again needs evidence.
- **Refusal evidence dominates.** It routes to `declined` from anywhere, with or without a result.
- **Only Stage B can suppress a number**, and only via `declined`.
- **Only Stage A outcomes retry automatically.** Every Stage B redial needs consent or a human, and
  anything uncertain lands in `needs-review`, which never retries.
- **No state is permanent-by-accident.** A live attempt is leased, and `ambiguous` is provisional —
  a late result re-enters classification from the top.
- **The cap bounds every path**, including callback-consented redials.

## Outcome Classification

A call that reaches a terminal state has not necessarily reached a consenting human. Providers
commonly return a completed call with an empty structured result when the agent talked to a carrier
message, voicemail, or silence. A call can also produce a perfectly well-formed structured result
while the customer was refusing to take part.

**The presence of a structured result is not evidence of consent.** Classification is therefore
driven by an evidence-backed `disposition` field, not by whether a result exists. See
[`references/structured-result.md`](references/structured-result.md).

Classify in **two stages, in this order**. Stage A decides whether a human took part at all.
Only if one did does Stage B read consent.

The staging is the contract, not a presentation choice. Consent fields are meaningless when nobody
answered — a voicemail grants no consent, so `consent_granted` is `false` there. Reading consent
before establishing that a human was reached turns every no-answer into a refusal.

### Stage A — was a human reached?

**Reachability is decided on call evidence, never on whether a structured result exists.** A real
conversation can return no result at all: extraction failed, the result failed validation, or the
customer refused and rang off before the model emitted anything. Inferring "nobody answered" from a
missing result would auto-retry those calls and redial a person who may have just refused.

#### The no-human evidence set

Exactly one thing authorises an automatic redial: **observed evidence from the call itself that no
person took part.** This is a closed list.

| Counts as no-human evidence | |
| --- | --- |
| voicemail or answering-machine greeting | carrier or network announcement |
| ring-out with no answer | the provider's own answered-by-machine / no-answer signal |
| silence throughout after the agent spoke | |

**Nothing else qualifies.** In particular these are *not* no-human evidence, however tempting:

- a missing or empty structured result
- the extractor's own `disposition: NotReached` — that is a model claim about the call, not an
  observation of it, and the same extractor mislabels refusals
- a provider that is unreachable, times out, or has no record of the attempt
- an expired lease
- a billing charge or usage record — that shows a call *was placed*, which if anything makes a
  conversation more likely, not less

Every one of those means **we do not know**. Unknown is `needs-review`, never a retry. The
asymmetry is deliberate: a needless manual check costs a minute, and a wrong redial reaches someone
who may have already refused.

#### Establishing reachability

| Reachability | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `human` | the provider reports a human answered, **or** the transcript contains customer speech that is not carrier or IVR audio |
| `no-human` | at least one item from the no-human evidence set above, and no contradicting customer speech |
| `indeterminate` | anything else, including every "not evidence" item listed above |

#### Then classify

| # | Outcome | Condition | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | `not-reached` | reachability is `no-human` | write no insight; queue a retry; **never** suppress the number |
| A2 | `ambiguous` | provider reported failure and reconciliation has not completed | write nothing; schedule reconciliation, not a retry |
| A3 | `failed` | provider reported failure **and** reconciliation positively establishes that **no call was placed** | write no insight; queue a retry; **never** suppress the number |
| A4 | `needs-review` | reachability is `indeterminate` — provider unreachable, unknown attempt, expired lease, extractor-only `NotReached` | write nothing beyond the raw record; **no automatic retry**; route to a human |

`disposition: NotReached` may **corroborate** no-human evidence, and it may never substitute for it.
On its own it yields `needs-review`, not `not-reached`.

Note the strictness of A3: reconciliation must show the call *did not happen*. "The provider does
not know" is not that; it is A4. Only a definite negative — no such call, never dialled — releases a
retry.

Where reachability is `human`, continue to Stage B; a missing or unusable result there resolves to
`needs-review` (B2), which never retries automatically.

**Refusal evidence outranks everything in this stage.** If the transcript or provider summary shows
the customer refusing or asking not to be called — even with no structured result, and even where
the provider labelled the call `NotReached` — classify as `declined` (B1) and apply the suppression
scope. A refusal that lost its structured result is still a refusal.

Stage A never suppresses a number and never records a refusal of its own accord. A customer who did
not answer has not refused anything.

### Stage B — a human took part, so consent governs

| # | Outcome | Condition | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | `declined` | `disposition` is `Declined` or `DoNotCall`, **or** `consent_granted` is false | record the refusal and its evidence; write no onboarding insight; queue **no** follow-up; cancel any pending retry; apply the suppression scope below |
| B2 | `needs-review` | no structured result at all, **or** required consent or disposition fields are missing, malformed, or contradicting the transcript, **or** reachability was `indeterminate` | write nothing beyond the raw record; **no automatic retry**; route to a human |
| B3 | `partial` | `disposition` is `EndedEarly` | write only the fields actually captured and mark the record partial; queue **no** follow-up unless the customer explicitly asked and evidence supports it; retry only under the callback-consent rule below |
| B4 | `onboarded` | `disposition` is `Completed` **and** `consent_granted` is true **and** a structured result is present | write insight; queue a follow-up only when requested |

### Suppression scope

`Declined` and `DoNotCall` both end this signup, but they are not the same instruction and must not
be recorded identically.

| Disposition | The customer said | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Declined` | not now, not this call | Suppress **this onboarding workflow** for this signup. Other contact the customer has separately opted into — transactional notices, support replies, a channel they initiated — is unaffected. |
| `DoNotCall` | stop calling me | Suppress **all outbound calling** to that number, across every workflow, indefinitely. Propagate it to the shared do-not-call record, not just this signup's row. |

If you cannot tell which the customer meant, record `DoNotCall`. Over-suppressing costs a
conversation; under-suppressing means calling someone who told you to stop.

Neither may be lifted by a later call result. Only an explicit opt-in from the customer through
another channel can reverse a suppression, and that reversal belongs to whatever system owns
consent — not to this skill.

Rules that follow from the staging and must not be relaxed:

- **Only Stage B can suppress a number.** A refusal requires a human who refused. `not-reached`,
  `ambiguous`, and `failed` must never mark a number do-not-call.
- **A follow-up task may only be created from `onboarded`, or from `partial` with explicit evidence
  of a request.** Never from `declined`, `needs-review`, `not-reached`, `ambiguous`, or `failed`.
- **A CRM write representing the customer as onboarded, interested, or requesting contact requires
  `onboarded`.** `declined` and `partial` may write only their disposition and evidence.
- **A malformed result from a call a human took part in is `needs-review`, never `not-reached`.**
  Coercing it to `not-reached` would queue an automatic retry and could redial someone who actually
  refused. When you cannot tell whether a human took part, treat the call as reached and route to
  review — the failure mode of a needless manual check is trivial; the failure mode of redialling a
  refusal is not.

Never present `not-reached` as a success. A dropped signup that displays as onboarded is worse than
a visible failure, because nobody follows up.

## Attempts, Retries, and Cancellation

International termination is unreliable in some corridors, and the same configuration can succeed
and then fail minutes later. See
[`references/international-routing.md`](references/international-routing.md).

### The guarantee

One signup yields **at most one conversation**, and **at most one attempt in flight at any moment**.
It may take up to three *attempts* to obtain that one conversation.

"One call per signup" would be the wrong guarantee — it cannot survive a corridor that drops half
its calls. The guarantee that matters is that a customer is never called while another attempt for
the same signup is live, and never called again once a conversation has happened.

**A conversation is any call a human took part in — Stage B — including `partial`.** Retries exist
to obtain a conversation, never to resume one. Once Stage B is reached, the attempt budget is spent
and further automatic calling stops. The single exception is an explicit, evidence-backed callback
request; see *Redialling after a conversation* below.

### Durable per-attempt idempotency

Retries are only safe if each attempt is durably recorded **before** the call is placed.

1. Allocate the next `attempt_no` for the signup and persist an attempt record under a uniqueness
   constraint on `(signup_id, attempt_no)`. If the insert conflicts, another worker owns this
   attempt — stop.
2. Enforce **at most one live attempt per signup** with its own constraint — a partial uniqueness
   constraint on `signup_id` restricted to non-terminal states. Uniqueness on
   `(signup_id, attempt_no)` alone does not provide this: two workers can allocate attempt 2 and
   attempt 3 concurrently and both dial.
3. **Bind the idempotency key to the canonical call payload**, not just to the attempt slot. Derive
   it deterministically from the attempt identity *and* a digest of exactly what will be dialled:

   ```text
   attempt_key = onboarding:<signup_id>:<attempt_no>:<digest>
   digest      = hash( E.164 destination + task/script version + result-schema version + locale )
   ```

   `onboarding:<signup_id>:<attempt_no>` alone identifies a slot, not a call. If the destination
   number is corrected, the script revised, or the schema changed between attempts, that key would
   silently cover a materially different call — and reconciliation would match a provider record
   that is not the one you placed, which is how a "no record found" turns into a wrong redial.
   Include the destination in the digest so a changed number can never inherit a prior attempt's
   identity.
4. Never derive an idempotency key from a timestamp, a random value, or a retry counter held only
   in memory. A key that changes on redelivery is not an idempotency key.
5. **Reconcile on the key, and verify the payload matches** before believing the answer. A provider
   record whose destination or script digest differs from the attempt you are reconciling is not
   evidence about that attempt — treat the attempt as `needs-review`.
6. Key webhook ingestion on the provider event id so redelivery cannot advance state twice.
7. **If placing the call fails after the attempt record exists — provider rejection, timeout,
   crash — close that attempt out before returning.** An attempt left live because the call was
   never actually placed blocks the signup forever.

### Stuck attempts must expire

Blocking new attempts while one is live is only safe if a live attempt cannot last forever. A
terminal webhook can be lost to a deploy, a signature change, or a provider outage. Without an
expiry the signup is stranded permanently: never resolved, never retried, and invisible because
nothing failed.

- Give every attempt a **lease** — a deadline by which it must reach a terminal state. A few
  minutes beyond the provider's maximum call duration is enough.
- When the lease expires, **reconcile before concluding anything.** Ask the provider for that
  attempt's state by its idempotency key.
  - **Terminal at the provider:** ingest that result through the normal path. The webhook was lost,
    not the call.
  - **Still live at the provider:** extend the lease once, then treat it as `ambiguous`.
  - **The provider positively reports the call was never placed:** close the attempt as `failed`.
    This is the only lease-expiry path that releases a retry, and it requires a definite negative.
  - **Unknown to the provider, or the provider is unreachable:** close the attempt as
    `needs-review`. Release the signup so it is no longer blocked, but **do not queue a retry.**
- **An expired lease is not evidence about the customer.** It says our bookkeeping failed, not that
  nobody answered. The call may well have connected and been refused. Expiry therefore resolves to
  `ambiguous`, `needs-review`, or a reconciled terminal result — never `not-reached`, never
  `declined`, never `onboarded`, and never a retry on its own.
- Releasing the signup and authorising a redial are **separate decisions.** Unblocking the attempt
  slot is bookkeeping; dialling again needs evidence. Do not let one imply the other.
- Surface stranded attempts to operators. A signup silently stuck is the failure mode this whole
  section exists to prevent.

### Ambiguous outcomes must be reconciled before retrying

A provider failure report is **not** proof that no call was placed. A degraded control plane can
report failure and dial minutes later.

- On a reported failure, mark the attempt `ambiguous` rather than `failed`, and schedule a
  reconciliation check instead of a retry.
- Wait a reconciliation window, default 15 minutes, then check the provider's billing records,
  call logs, or platform logs for that idempotency key.
- **A billing charge or usage record proves the call happened, not that it went unanswered.** It is
  evidence *against* a retry, not for one. If the call was placed but you cannot obtain its outcome,
  the attempt is `needs-review` — a human reads the record. It is never `not-reached`, because a
  placed call may have reached someone who refused.
- Only promote `ambiguous` to `failed`, and only then schedule a retry, when reconciliation
  **positively establishes that no call was placed.** "The provider has no record" is not that;
  absence in a log you cannot fully trust is `needs-review`.

**`ambiguous` is provisional, not a verdict.** If a late result arrives — from the delayed webhook
or from reconciliation — re-run the full classification on it, Stage A then Stage B. A call that
looked failed can turn out to have been a real conversation, including a refusal, and that refusal
must take effect exactly as if it had arrived on time. Never let a provisional `ambiguous` or a
scheduled retry outrank a real outcome that shows up late; cancel the retry instead.

### Retry rules

Automatic retries are permitted **only for Stage A outcomes**, where no human took part and so no
conversation has happened:

- Retry `not-reached` and reconciled `failed`.
- **Never** automatically retry `declined`, `partial`, or `needs-review`.
- Cap at three attempts per signup, including the first. **The cap is absolute.** When it is
  reached, stop and surface the signup for manual handling — including when the customer requested
  a callback. A callback request is permission to call, not extra budget.
- Space attempts by at least 30 minutes.
- Confine attempts to the recipient's local working hours. A call at 01:40 local proves nothing
  about reachability; it only proves the person was asleep.
- **Working hours require a known timezone.** Take it from an explicit `timezone` field, or derive
  it from the `region` supplied with the signup. Do not guess from the phone number's country code
  when that country spans several zones, and do not fall back to the operator's own clock. If the
  timezone cannot be established, do not schedule an automatic retry — surface it for manual
  scheduling instead. An unknown timezone is a reason to ask, not a reason to dial.
- Stop retrying the moment any attempt reaches Stage B.

### Redialling after a conversation

A `partial` call is a conversation that ended early. The customer may have hung up *because* they
did not want to continue, and the workflow cannot tell the difference from a dropped line. So a
partial does not license another call.

Redialling after any Stage B outcome requires **one** of:

1. **Evidence-backed callback consent.** The customer explicitly asked to be called back, captured
   in `callback_consent` with supporting words in `callback_consent_evidence`. Honour a stated time
   or window. Absent or generic evidence does not qualify — silence, politeness, and an
   unfinished answer are not a callback request.
2. **Manual review.** A human inspects the record and authorises the call. Record who authorised it.

`needs-review` always takes route 2. A malformed or contradictory consent record must never be
resolved by calling the customer again to find out.

A redial authorised this way is a new attempt against the same cap. It never resets the budget, and
`declined` remains terminal regardless of any later callback claim.

### Cancelling a pending retry

Every scheduled retry must be cancellable, and must carry a stable id so it can be addressed.

Cancel automatically when any of these occur:

- a conversation completes for that signup
- the outcome is `declined`, or the customer requests do-not-call by any channel
- the customer record is deleted, opts out, or is merged away
- the attempt cap is reached
- an operator cancels it manually

Cancellation must be idempotent, must be safe to call for an already-cancelled or already-fired
retry, and must record what triggered it. If the host cannot cancel a scheduled job, do not
schedule one — surface the retry as a manual task instead, and say so rather than implying a retry
is pending.

## Safety Rules

Read [`references/safety.md`](references/safety.md) for the full contract. Always:

- Treat every call as a real-world side effect with a cost.
- Call only the configured E.164 number, and only for a customer who signed up.
- Ask consent at the start of the call and honor refusal immediately and permanently.
- Mask phone numbers in summaries, dashboards, and logs.
- Never expose API keys, tokens, or webhook secrets in output.
- Never state pricing, delivery, policy, or legal or medical guidance from memory.
- Keep transcripts and recordings inside the systems the customer was told about.

## Output Format

After an attempt, report:

- outcome, one of `onboarded`, `partial`, `declined`, `needs-review`, `not-reached`, `failed`, or
  `ambiguous` while reconciliation is pending
- the stage that decided it, so a suppression is always traceable to a human who refused
- masked phone number
- `disposition` and the `disposition_evidence` that supports it
- structured result fields the outcome permits you to write
- whether a follow-up task was created, and why — or explicitly why not
- attempt number out of the cap, and the retry decision: scheduled with its window, cancelled with
  the trigger, blocked pending review, or not permitted
- for any redial after a conversation, the callback consent evidence or the human who authorised it

If no call was placed, report `status: not called`, the exact blocker, and what the user must
supply next.

Never claim a customer was onboarded, interested, or requesting contact without a `Completed`
disposition and granted consent to support it. A populated structured result alone is not
sufficient — a refusal can carry one.
