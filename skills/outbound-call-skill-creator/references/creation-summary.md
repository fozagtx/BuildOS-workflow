# Creation Summary

Use this reference after the generated business skill has been written and validated.

## Purpose

The creation summary is the user's final review surface. It should show what was fixed at creation time, what remains parameterized for runtime, which checks passed or are blocked, and how the generated skill can be discovered.

## Required Fields

Include:

- skill name
- generated skill directory
- output scope
- discoverability or reload note
- binding level
- source onboarding status, sampled source instance, sample fetch result, and default goal source
- provider onboarding status, provider host runtime, MCP route setup and provider auth check results, compatible MCP tools, one-off capability, and blocker if any
- allowed and required runtime parameters
- source family, access method, and required fields
- consent or outreach basis
- dedupe key or dedupe state rule
- outbound goal contract summary
- selected execution mode and unavailable modes
- result-output policy, fixed or runtime-resolved target mode, target binding, and field mapping
- creation-time preflight result or blocker
- mandatory runtime gate checks before real calls
- MCP provider route
- validation command and result

## Summary Shape

Use this shape:

```text
Skill: <business-skill-name>
Directory: <generated-skill-directory>
Discovery: <known-active-root | reload-needed | add-location-needed | nonstandard-path>
Binding level: <fully-bound | parameterized-bound>
Source onboarding: <auth/access check, sampled source instance, and sample fetch result>
Provider onboarding: <provider host runtime, MCP route setup check, auth readiness, compatible MCP tools, one-off capability, and blocker if any>
Runtime parameters: <allowed parameters or none>
Source: <source family, access method, required fields>
Outreach basis: <source-level basis, consent field, or approved source basis>
Dedupe: <key or state rule>
Goal: <one-sentence call purpose and completion criteria>
Execution mode: <selected mode and any unavailable modes>
Result output: <policy, fixed or runtime-resolved target mode, target binding, and field mapping>
Preflight: <passed | blocked | not run, with reason>
Runtime gate: <checks that must pass before real calls>
Provider route: https://seleven-mcp-sg.airudder.com/mcp/openagent_oauth
Validation: <command and result>
```

## Safety

The summary must distinguish fixed values from runtime parameters. Do not show credentials, tokens, cookies, callback URLs, confirmation tokens, or full phone numbers.

If a required source or durable result-output value is unknown, report it as a creation blocker and stop before generating the skill.
