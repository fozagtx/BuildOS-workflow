# Safety

Use this reference when creating a generated outbound phone-call business skill.

## Creator Safety

The creator must not generate a business skill that calls arbitrary phone-looking values. It must capture a binding level, source contract, outreach basis, E.164 phone-number field, dedupe key, execution policy, and durable result-output behavior.

If the user cannot explain why records are authorized for phone follow-up, stop and ask for a consent field or approved source basis before generating a skill.

Default to a `parameterized-bound` skill when the user wants reuse but has not asked for a single fixed source instance. Use `fully-bound` for stable production or scheduled workflows.

## Generated Skill Safety

Every generated business skill must include rules for:

- explicit user intent before processing records for calls
- binding-level compatibility with the selected execution mode
- E.164 phone numbers
- no country-code guessing
- masked phone numbers in summaries
- no credential exposure
- no hidden recurring schedules
- no duplicate jobs
- dedupe by stable candidate ID or source record ID
- clear cancellation behavior for scheduled workflows
- dry-run or approved direct execution policy
- best-effort creation-time preflight and mandatory runtime gate requirements before real calls
- sensitive-domain boundaries

## Direct Execution

Direct execution is allowed only when the generated skill's creation-time contract explicitly says that a concrete request such as "process all June 20 records" authorizes real calls after validation.

Direct execution requires a `fully-bound` skill or a `parameterized-bound` skill whose concrete runtime parameters pass the runtime gate.

Direct execution still requires:

- candidate validation
- outreach basis validation
- dedupe checks
- source and durable result-output runtime gate checks when the workflow is parameterized
- masked summaries
- skipping unsafe records
- source writeback, source-adjacent result artifact output, or local result CSV output, with session-table output only as a last-resort attended fallback

If direct execution is not configured, generated skills must dry-run first and ask the user to approve the exact pending call list.

## Serial Candidate Execution

After the user approves the exact pending call list, generated skills should serially process all ready candidates. After execution approval, do not ask the user to continue, confirm the next candidate, or approve additional provider runs. Each candidate must reach a terminal result or skip state before the next candidate starts.

If one candidate fails, record the failure and continue with the next candidate when it is safe to continue. Stop the batch when authentication is missing, the MCP route is unavailable, required provider tools are unavailable, dedupe state cannot be trusted, or continuing would be unsafe.

Provider terminal instructions such as `report_result` or `do not start another call` apply only to the current provider run. After recording the current candidate result, continue the approved batch unless a batch-level safety blocker appears.

Do not write call results before provider result finalization. Terminal provider status must pass full-history provider reconciliation before source writeback, source-adjacent result artifact output, local result CSV output, or session-table fallback, and negative terminal outcomes such as `no_answer`, `failed`, or `no conversation captured` must pass a negative terminal stability check.

After all candidates are complete, write configured source results, a source-adjacent result artifact, or a local result CSV, then report one final batch summary. Output a session table only when durable output validation is blocked and the run is attended; treat it as non-persistent and unsuitable for unattended scheduled automation unless the user explicitly accepts the host session transcript as the record.

## Sensitive Domains

Generated goals must not provide medical, legal, financial, or emergency advice.

For sensitive workflows, generated calls may collect logistics, confirm preferences, schedule follow-up, or route to a human. They must not provide diagnosis, legal conclusions, investment advice, emergency instructions, or other professional judgment.

## Credentials

Do not expose:

- OAuth access tokens or refresh tokens
- MCP auth tokens
- provider credentials
- callback URLs
- confirmation tokens
- cookies
- private full phone numbers in user-facing summaries

## Cancellation

For one-off calls, cancellation is possible only before the provider call runs.

For scheduled processing, cancellation belongs to the host scheduler. Generated skills must explain how to find and disable the scheduler job when the host supports it.
