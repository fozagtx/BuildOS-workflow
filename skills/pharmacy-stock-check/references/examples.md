# Examples

All numbers below are from the reserved fictional range +1 555 0100–0199.
Replace them with real E.164 numbers you have permission to call.

---

## Example 1 — a straightforward search

**User:** I need amoxicillin 500mg, 21 capsules. Can you check these three
pharmacies? +1 555 0100, +1 555 0101, +1 555 0102.

**Agent:** Before I call, let me confirm:

- Medication: amoxicillin 500mg, 21 capsules
- Pharmacies: 3 numbers in the US
- This will place 3 real phone calls now

I'll ask each pharmacy about stock, price, whether a prescription is required,
and whether they can hold it. I won't place an order or reserve anything.

Shall I go ahead?

**User:** Yes.

**Agent:** *(one run per pharmacy, concurrently)*

```
Riverside Pharmacy (…0100)      partial   10 units   $5.00   Rx: yes   hold 48h   conf 0.82
    They have only 10 units available, less than the requested 21 capsules.
Oakhill Chemist (…0101)         yes       40 units   $6.20   Rx: yes   hold 24h   conf 0.91
Station Road Pharmacy (…0102)   no        —          —       —         —          conf 0.88
    Suggested trying their branch on Mill Lane.
```

Oakhill has the full quantity and will hold it for 24 hours. Riverside is
cheaper but only has 10 of the 21 you need.

All three need a prescription. I haven't reserved anything — you'd need to call
and ask them to hold it yourself.

Want the transcript for any of these?

---

## Example 2 — a local number, so the agent asks rather than guesses

**User:** Check if the chemist on 07700 900123 has ibuprofen 400mg.

**Agent:** I need that number in full international format before I can dial —
I won't guess a country code. If that's a UK mobile it would be
+44 7700 900123, but please confirm.

Also, how many do you need? The pharmacist will ask, and "partial stock" only
means something if I know the target quantity.

---

## Example 3 — urgency, so the agent does not call

**User:** I've run out of my heart medication and I feel awful. Call every
pharmacy near me right now.

**Agent:** I'm not going to start calling for this — it's the wrong tool for
what you're describing.

Each call takes a few minutes and I'd be working through a list while you're
unwell. If you've missed doses of a heart medication and you're feeling bad,
please contact your doctor, an urgent care service, or emergency services now.
A pharmacist reached directly can also advise on an emergency supply.

If it turns out you just need to locate stock and there's no urgency, I'm happy
to ring round then.

---

## Example 4 — the pharmacist suggests something else

**Result:** `alternative_suggested = "pharmacist mentioned co-amoxiclav"`

**Agent reports:**

> Station Road doesn't have it. The pharmacist mentioned they stock
> co-amoxiclav.

**Not:**

> ~~Station Road doesn't have it, but co-amoxiclav would work instead.~~

The agent relays what a pharmacist said. It does not endorse a substitute or
imply equivalence — that's a clinical judgement, and nobody qualified reviewed
this exchange.

---

## Example 5 — a confident "no" outranks an unreliable "yes"

```
Pharmacy                Stock    Qty  Price  Conf
Oakhill Chemist (…0101) no        —      —   0.95
Riverside (…0100)       yes       —      —   0.31  ⚠ unverified
    Call quality was poor; several answers were unclear.
```

**Agent:** Oakhill definitely doesn't have it — that's a clear answer.
Riverside said yes, but confidence is low: the line was bad and several answers
were unclear. I've ranked it below because an unreliable yes is worse than a
reliable no when you'd be travelling on it. Ring Riverside yourself before you
set off.

Verification is the **primary** sort key, ahead of stock status. A
low-confidence "yes" appearing at the top of the list is the specific failure
that sends a sick person on a pointless journey.

---

## Example 6 — a call that didn't complete reports nothing

```
Station Road Pharmacy (…0102)   unknown   —   —   —   ⚠ unverified
    Call did not complete (no answer). No stock information obtained.
```

The run ended `NO ANSWER` with `task_completed: false`. Even if a partial
summary came back, no stock fields are reported — "could not be reached" is a
distinct outcome from "not in stock", and scraping a half-finished call for a
stock answer is how a patient gets sent somewhere on a sentence nobody finished.

---

## Example 7 — a number that isn't E.164

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv
Invalid phone number: '07700900123' is not E.164. Expected + followed by
country code and number, 8-15 digits total, e.g. +15550100. Do not guess a
country code — ask the user.
```

Validation runs before anything else, in both dry run and live mode. Nothing is
dialled and no plan is created.

---

## Example 8 — dry run, fully offline

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv

DRY RUN — offline. No credentials read, nothing sent.

  Riverside Pharmacy (…0100) — would send:
  {
    "tool": "plan_call",
    "goal": "You are calling a pharmacy on behalf of a patient…",
    "to_phones": ["+15550100"],
    "region": "US"
  }
  …

  3 call(s) would be placed. Add --live to dial.
```

No token is read and no socket is opened. The numbers are validated and the
payload is printed locally.

Note this deliberately does **not** call `plan_call` to check the goal wording,
even though `plan_call` is free of charge. Free of charge isn't free of
consequence: it would transmit the recipient's number and the medication being
sought to a third party, from a mode the user was told places no calls.

---

## Example 9 — an interrupted call is not redialled

The process was killed while a call was in progress. Rerunning:

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv --live
  …0100: resuming run 4BJPgjIFv3gZ
```

It polls the existing run rather than planning a new one. The pharmacist is not
called twice.

If the crash happened in the narrower window *after* the call was submitted but
*before* a run id came back:

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv --live
  …0100: a call was submitted but no run id was recorded, so whether the
  phone rang is unknown. Not retrying automatically. Check the CALL-E
  dashboard for plan pX70PPR62, then either record the run id or remove
  this entry to allow a redial.
```

Ambiguity is not resolved by guessing. A duplicate call to a pharmacist costs
money and looks like a malfunctioning system contacting a business repeatedly
about a patient.

---

## Example 10 — two processes, one recipient

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv --live &
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv --live
  …0100: held by live process 48213. Not dialling concurrently.
```

Claims are taken under an exclusive lock, so two processes can't both conclude
the recipient is free and both dial.

---

## Example 11 — offline planning with a fictional pharmacy

This standards-reserved number is for the offline planning path only. It cannot
be dialed and is not a source of stock data.

```bash
$ printf 'name,phone,address\nFictional Pharmacy,+14155550132,Reserved offline example\n' \
    > pharmacies.hotline.csv
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.hotline.csv

Pharmacy          Stock     Qty  Price  Rx       Hold  Conf
Fictional Pharmacy unknown    —      —  unknown     —  0.34  ⚠ unverified
    The recipient did not provide stock information.
```

The row is marked unverified rather than filled with plausible guesses. This
exercise performs no network request and places no call.

---

## Example 12 — a duplicated row is not dialled twice

`pharmacies.csv` lists the same number under two names — easily done when a
chain has branches:

```csv
name,phone,address
Oakhill Chemist,+15550101,High Street
Oakhill (High St),+15550101,duplicate of the above
```

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv --live
Skipping 1 duplicate row(s) for recipients already in this batch:
  Oakhill (High St) (…0101)
```

Rows are dispatched concurrently, so without this both would ring the same
pharmacist within a second of each other. A file lock doesn't catch it — both
coroutines share a pid — so duplicates are collapsed before dispatch and the
in-flight set is tracked in-process as well.

---

## Example 13 — a credential that can't be bound is refused

Even with a single cached credential, if nothing ties it to the endpoint being
called:

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv --live
Found 1 cached CALL-E credential(s), none of which can be bound to
https://seleven-mcp-sg.airudder.com/mcp/openagent_oauth.

`calle auth status` did not report a matching endpoint, and no cache records
one. A bearer token is issued for a single origin, so sending one that might
belong to a different provider is a credential disclosure, not a routing
mistake — refusing rather than assuming.

Either run `calle auth login` against
https://seleven-mcp-sg.airudder.com/mcp/openagent_oauth, or set
CALLE_TOKEN_CACHE explicitly:
  /Users/you/.calle-mcp/cli/4811f3e.../token.json
```

"Only one exists" is not evidence that it belongs to this provider.

And if the CLI is authenticated somewhere else entirely:

```bash
The CALL-E CLI is authenticated against https://other.example/mcp, but this
skill is configured to call https://seleven-mcp-sg.airudder.com/mcp/...
Refusing to send that credential to a different origin.
```

---

## Example 14 — the call is not logged, and derived text is scrubbed

A live run. The pharmacist reads out a branch number:

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies p.csv --live
    calling task created
    calling task status=calling
    Call ended; syncing final Calling result.

Pharmacy         Stock  Qty  Price    Rx   Hold  Conf
Oakhill          yes     40  6.2 GBP  yes  24h   0.90
    Try the Mill Lane branch on [redacted …0123]
```

Two things are happening. The realtime speech events — `Callee said: …` — are
not logged at all; only progress events are. And `pharmacist_notes`, which the
model lifted out of the conversation, has had the number scrubbed while keeping
the part that's useful.

Prices and quantities are untouched: redaction applies to runs of eight or more
digits, so `6.2 GBP`, `40` and `24h` survive.

To watch a call as it happens — useful when debugging a prompt — opt in
explicitly:

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies p.csv --live --show-conversation
    Callee said: try the Mill Lane branch on [redacted …0123]
```

Still redacted. The flag controls whether speech is shown, not whether numbers
are protected.

The stored run dump keeps the unredacted transcript — it's the evidence behind
the result — and is written 0600 into an ignored directory.

---

## Example 15 — changing configuration neither resumes nor redials

A call is in flight to `…0100`, placed in region GB. Rerunning with a different
region:

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies p.csv --region US --live
  …0100: an unresolved call exists for this recipient and goal, but it was
  made under a different configuration (region: pending='GB' now='US').
  Not resuming — a plan or run id from one endpoint or account is meaningless
  under another. Not redialling either — the earlier call may still be live,
  and this person should not be rung twice.
  Resolve it under the original configuration, or remove the entry
  deliberately once you know what happened.
```

The exclusion claim is `sha256(phone|goal)` — deliberately free of endpoint,
account and region. Had those been part of it, changing region would have made
the live call invisible and dialled the pharmacist a second time.

The same refusal covers re-authenticating as a different account on the same
endpoint:

```
(principal: pending='acct-A' now='acct-B')
```

And if the account can't be identified at all, an unresolved call fails closed
rather than being resumed or redialled:

```
  …0100: an unresolved call exists, but the authenticated account could not
  be identified, so it cannot be confirmed as ours. Failing closed rather
  than resuming another account's run or redialling. Set CALLE_ACCOUNT_ID,
  or resolve the entry deliberately.
```

Changing the claim scheme bumps `LEDGER_SCHEMA`. An older ledger holding
unfinished entries is refused rather than read as empty:

```
Run ledger .pharmacy_runs.json uses schema 2 (now 3) and still holds 1
unfinished entry. Claim keys changed, so those entries would not be found
and their recipients would be dialled again.
```

---

## Example 14 — budget refuses before dialling

```bash
$ python3 scripts/pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv --live --max-calls 2

BudgetExceeded: 3 call(s) needed, 2 left of 2.
```

The check runs across the whole batch before anything is dialled, so a search
fails cleanly rather than stopping halfway with two calls spent and no complete
answer.
