# Safety boundaries for medical-adjacent phone workflows

A phone agent asking a pharmacist about a medication sits close to several lines
it must not cross. These rules are written for the pharmacy stock-check skill
but apply to any health-adjacent calling workflow.

---

## The agent gathers information; it does not advise

**In scope:** whether a named medication is in stock, how many units, price,
whether a prescription is required, whether they will hold it, what the
pharmacist said about alternatives.

**Out of scope:** whether the user should take the medication, whether an
alternative is equivalent, dosage guidance, interaction checks, or anything
resembling clinical judgement.

When a pharmacist suggests an alternative, report it as reported speech — *"the
pharmacist mentioned they stock X"* — not as a recommendation. The distinction
matters because a user acting on a substitute suggested by an automated system
has been given advice nobody qualified reviewed.

---

## Never transact

The agent does not order, reserve, pay for, or commit to collecting anything.
"Can you hold it?" is a question. "Please hold it" is a commitment, and the
agent is not authorised to make one.

If a pharmacist offers to set stock aside, record the offer and its duration.
Let the user decide.

---

## Not for emergencies

A phone agent working through a list takes minutes per call. Someone who needs
medication urgently should not be waiting on it.

If the request suggests urgency — a missed critical dose, an acute reaction,
distress — say plainly that this workflow is not appropriate and point toward
emergency services or urgent care. Do not start calling.

---

## Prescription requirements are reported, never circumvented

If a medication requires a prescription, that fact is part of the result. The
agent must never suggest a way around it, ask a pharmacist to dispense without
one, or imply the user has a prescription they have not confirmed.

---

## Uncertainty must survive to the user

The user may travel somewhere while unwell on the strength of a result. That
raises the cost of overconfidence well above the usual.

- **Gate on completion before reporting anything.** A call that failed, hit
  voicemail or was cut off can still carry a partially filled summary. If
  `task_completed` isn't true and the run didn't reach `COMPLETED`, emit no
  stock fields at all — report that the pharmacy could not be reached.
- **Verification must outrank stock status in any ranking.** A low-confidence
  "yes" appearing above a high-confidence "no" is the specific failure that
  sends a sick person on a pointless journey. Rank verified results first,
  then by stock.
- Surface the confidence score. Do not average it away or hide it behind a tick.
- Show low-confidence results as needing verification, not as facts.
- Offer the transcript. Everything reported should be checkable against what was
  actually said.
- "Could not be reached" is a distinct outcome from "not in stock". Never
  collapse them.

## A dry run must not transmit anything

If a workflow advertises a dry run, that has to mean nothing leaves the machine
— no credentials read, no socket opened, no payload sent.

Calling a planning or validation endpoint during a "dry run" transmits the
recipient's phone number and, here, the medication someone is looking for. That
is health-adjacent information about an identifiable person going to a third
party, from a mode the user was told was inert. Validate and print locally
instead.

---

## Privacy

- Callers are told immediately that they are speaking to an automated
  assistant.
- Do not state the patient's name, condition, or any identifying detail to the
  pharmacy. The medication and quantity are all that's needed.
- Mask phone numbers in summaries and logs — pharmacy name plus last four
  digits. This includes dry-run and debug output. Terminal text ends up in
  shell scrollback, CI logs and screen recordings, none of which the person
  whose number it is agreed to.

- **The same applies to anything derived from the call.** It is easy to mask the
  number you dialled and then print the conversation that number produced. A
  provider's activity feed quotes speech as it happens; extracted fields like
  "notes" and "alternative suggested" are lifted out of the same conversation.
  A pharmacist who reads out a branch number has now put it in both.

  Scrub free text on every output path, and withhold realtime speech unless the
  operator asks for it. The pharmacist agreed to answer a question, not to have
  their words logged.

- **Redact by shape, not by field.** You cannot enumerate every field that might
  contain a number, because the model decides what goes in them. Filter runs of
  eight or more digits out of any free text on its way to a log or a terminal,
  and leave prices, quantities and durations intact.
- Transcripts contain a third party's voice. Store them under a retention policy
  and do not publish them.

---

## Calling businesses responsibly

- Identify as automated in the opening line, before asking anything. This is
  both the ethical default and the practical one — it materially improves the
  chance a pharmacist engages.
- Keep calls short. A pharmacist is working.
- One call per pharmacy per request. Retries are for no-answer, not for a
  better answer.
- Respect business hours for the recipient's region.
- Accept "no" and end the call.

---

## No hidden recurring work

This is a one-shot workflow. If a user wants a repeated check:

- create the schedule explicitly, on request
- state clearly how many calls it will place and how often
- tell the user how to cancel, in the same message
- never create a schedule as a side effect of a one-off request

---

## An uncertain call must never be retried automatically

If a request to place a call was sent and the response was lost — a timeout, a
crash, a dropped connection — you do not know whether the phone rang.

Retrying is not the safe default. The safe default is to stop and say so. A
duplicate call to a pharmacist costs money, wastes their time, and in a
health-adjacent context looks like a malfunctioning system contacting a
business repeatedly about a patient.

Record the "about to dial" state *before* sending the request, so a lost
response is distinguishable from a request that was never sent. Clearing that
state requires a human deciding what happened — check the provider's dashboard,
then either record the run or release the entry deliberately.

The same reasoning applies to concurrency. Two processes that both read "no
call in progress" will both dial. Claims must be atomic and locked, not
best-effort.

A file lock is necessary but not sufficient. Two coroutines inside one process
share a pid, so a pid-based ownership check passes for both — and a batch that
dispatches rows concurrently will dial a duplicated recipient twice. Track
in-flight recipients in-process as well, and collapse duplicate rows before
dispatch.

## Credentials and recordings are owner-only

Two kinds of file here are more sensitive than they look:

- **The run ledger** holds confirmation tokens that authorise placing a call.
- **Terminal run dumps** hold the full transcript of a conversation with a
  third party who agreed to talk to an assistant, not to have their words
  stored where anyone on the machine can read them.

Write both with mode 0600, into a dedicated directory rather than the working
directory, and add that directory to `.gitignore`.

The two protections do different jobs and neither substitutes for the other.
0600 stops other accounts on the machine reading a transcript. Ignoring stops
the file reaching a public repository, which is the failure that actually
happens — a token in a public repo is a token in a public repo, however
short-lived, and permissions are irrelevant once it's pushed.

## Authenticate as the account you meant to

Credential caches accumulate: a second account, a different environment, a
stale login. Picking one by sort order works right up until it doesn't, and the
failure is silent — calls placed from the wrong number, billed to the wrong
balance, attributed to the wrong party.

Bind the token to the endpoint being called. If the correct one cannot be
determined, stop and ask. Guessing which identity to act as is not a recoverable
error once the phone has rung.

A single cache is not self-evidently the right one. "There's only one" says
nothing about which provider issued it — and a bearer token sent to an origin it
wasn't issued for is a working credential handed to a stranger. That failure is
quieter and worse than a call placed from the wrong account: nothing visibly
goes wrong, and the disclosure has already happened.

## Exclusion and reconciliation are different questions

Recording "a call to this number about this thing is in progress" involves two
questions that look like one, and answering them with a single key is a bug in
whichever direction you resolve it.

**"Should I dial this person?"** must be answered on recipient and purpose
alone. Any configuration you add to that key — endpoint, account, region —
becomes a way to make a live call invisible. Change the value, the key changes,
the pending entry isn't found, and someone already on the phone gets rung again.

**"Can I resume this plan?"** needs the whole configuration, because a plan or
run id issued by one provider under one account means nothing under another.

So the claim is coarse and the attempt is specific, nested beneath it. When the
stored attempt doesn't match the current configuration, the safe action is
neither: don't resume something you can't act on, and don't redial someone whose
earlier call may still be running. Stop and surface it.

Version the store. When claim keys change, previously written entries won't
match anything you now compute, and an unmatched in-flight call reads as "never
started".

## Know whose call it is

Namespacing on a credential cache directory is not the same as knowing the
account. If the provider derives that directory from the server URL — CALL-E
does — then re-authenticating as someone else on the same endpoint reuses it,
and one account's unfinished run can be resumed with another's credentials.

Derive identity from the account: an id recorded alongside the credential, or
the subject claim of a token. If it cannot be established, unfinished state
cannot be confirmed as yours. Fail closed on reconciliation rather than assuming
— resuming a stranger's run, or redialling on the assumption that no call
exists, are both worse than stopping.

## Cost is a safety property

Calls cost money and free allowances are small. A workflow that silently spends
a user's balance has harmed them.

- Count phones, not plans — one batch can spend N calls.
- Check the budget for the whole request before dialling anything.
- Default to dry-run; require an explicit flag for live calls.
- Never re-dial to recover data already paid for.
