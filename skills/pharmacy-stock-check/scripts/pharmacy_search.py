Pharmacy stock check — reference implementation for the pharmacy-stock-check
Agent Skill.

Dry run is FULLY OFFLINE. It loads no credentials, opens no socket, and sends
no phone number or medication context anywhere. It validates the input and
prints the exact payload it would send. Only --live touches the network.

    python3 pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv           # offline
    python3 pharmacy_search.py --pharmacies pharmacies.csv --live    # calls

Live mode requires the CALL-E CLI to be authenticated and fastmcp installed:

    npm install -g @call-e/cli && calle auth login
    pip install fastmcp

Sample numbers use the reserved fictional range +1 555 0100–0199. Replace them
with real E.164 numbers you have permission to call.
