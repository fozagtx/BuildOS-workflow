    Confirmation requires one of two things from a USER turn:
      - the organization's own distinctive name, STATED rather than asked and
        not under negation: "Northside, this is the front desk", "Thanks for
        calling Northside, how can I help you?". Anything the respondent asks
        or echoes establishes nothing, whether or not it carries a comma
        ("Example Family Medicine?", "Example Family Medicine, right?"), and a
        correction ("No, this is Example Family Medicine") counts by what it
        names, or
      - an explicit affirmative answering an identity question that the agent
        actually asked AND that named this listing.

    Generic pleasantries deliberately do not count. "Hello", "how can I help
    you", and "sure" are what any human says on any phone.

    **Denial or correction always wins, wherever it appears in the turn.**
    Checked first and for the whole call, because "No, this is not Example
    Family Medicine" contains the name and used to return True here, and
    "Example Family Medicine? No, this is Buckhead Clinic" put the name BEFORE
    the correction, where a before-the-name negation window cannot see it. An
    explicit denial read as a confirmation is worse than fail-open: it is
    inverted, and it would attribute a later answer to a party that had just
    told us they are not the listing.

    Without --org there is nothing to confirm against, so this returns False
    and every claim abstains. That is the fail-closed direction on purpose.
