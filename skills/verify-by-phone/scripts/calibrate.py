"""Calibrate the abstention threshold with split conformal prediction.

Standard library only, no credentials, no calls: runs on labeled scenario
data (see references/sample-scenarios.jsonl). The guarantee and the gate both
live in gate.py, which extract_answer.py also uses, so the threshold printed
here is the threshold that decides real answers. It is printed for exactly
that reason: feed it to `extract_answer.py --qhat`.
