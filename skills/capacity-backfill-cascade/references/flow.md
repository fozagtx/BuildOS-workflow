## Decision table

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| consent=false | skip, audit SKIPPED_NO_CONSENT |
| target already dialled this run | skip, audit SKIPPED_DUPLICATE |
| outside call window | skip, audit SKIPPED_OUT_OF_WINDOW |
| budget exhausted | stop before dialing, write back state |
| booking CANCELLED | start cascade for that slot |
| waitlist ACCEPTED | mark slot RECOVERED, stop cascade for the slot |
| waitlist DECLINED | try the next candidate |
| NO_ANSWER | stop, escalate in the staff report (never auto-redial) |
| operator cancels the run | audit CANCELLED_BY_OPERATOR, refuse further dials |
