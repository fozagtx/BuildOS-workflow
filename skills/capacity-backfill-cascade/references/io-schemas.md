## waitlist.jsonl

| Field | Type | Notes |

| entry_id | string | unique id, e.g. W-001 |
| name | string | guest name |
| phone | string | E.164 number; fictional reserved numbers in samples |
| party_size | integer | seats needed |

## OUTCOME protocol

Every live call goal begins with self-identification as an automated assistant
(disclosure by design) and instructs the agent to end the call by stating exactly one
of:

- Confirm calls: OUTCOME: CONFIRMED, OUTCOME: CANCELLED, OUTCOME: RESCHEDULED,
  OUTCOME: NO_ANSWER
- Offer calls: OUTCOME: ACCEPTED, OUTCOME: DECLINED, OUTCOME: NO_ANSWER

The client parses the trailing OUTCOME token from the call summary and maps it to the
record status. Unparsable completed calls become ERROR and are escalated to staff.

## Outputs

- `state/runs/<run-id>/audit.jsonl` - append-only decision log
- `state/runs/<run-id>/report.md` - masked staff report

## Sourcing the inputs

These schemas are the integration boundary. Hosts keep waitlists and reservations in
whatever system they already use - a booking platform, a POS, or a shared sheet - and
any export or API poll that maps records into the fields above feeds the cascade. The
consent flag is captured when a guest joins the waitlist; records without consent are
skipped and audited, never dialed.
